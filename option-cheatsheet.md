```

| filter | Filter the results | Object |

### Example Object

```js
var options = {
  limit: 10,
  offset: 20,
  like: {
    name: "^M"
  },
  filter: {
    facilities: [
      "ATM",
      "DBT",
      "PETROL_FILLING_STATION"
    ],
    type: "extra"
  }
}
```

#### Small Note
The Like and Filter options allow for `AND` and `AND|OR` operations in the API. This has yet to be implemented in this wrapper. Currently the wrapper supports only `AND` statements. For example if you have:

```js
facilities: [
  "ATM",
  "DBT"
]
```

The wrapper will send a request looking for results with ATM **and** DBT. The `AND|OR` feature is on my to-do list.

Found one I haven't included? Feel free to submit a Pull Request adding it to the table.
Make sure you include the `name` attribute under the *Facility* column, and the `description` attribute under the *Description* column. Also please insert in its correct slot alphabetically.
